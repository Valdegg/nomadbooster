Eurostat Tourism Load Ratio Data Integration

Data Source: Eurostat "Tourist Nights Spent" statistics
URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tour_occ_nim/default/table
Access Method: CSV download from Eurostat database
Update Frequency: Dynamic seasonal (monthly/quarterly updates)
Data Type: Time-dependent city properties

Metric: tourism_load_ratio (float, tourist-to-resident ratio)
Description: Ratio of tourist nights spent to local population, indicating tourism density.
Formula: (Annual tourist nights spent) ÷ (City population)
Higher values indicate more touristic cities, lower values more authentic/local experience.

Integration Status: ◻️ Simple formula - Straightforward calculation from available data
Implementation: Download Eurostat tourism statistics CSV, extract nights spent by city/region,
divide by population data, calculate seasonal variations, and output structured JSON.

Seasonal Variation: 
- Tourism varies significantly by season (summer peaks, winter lows)
- Calculate monthly tourism ratios for seasonal filtering
- Base ratio from annual averages, seasonal multipliers for time-dependent queries

Output: ../data/sources/eurostat_tourism_load.json
Schema: {"city": str, "country": str, "tourism_load_ratio": float, "tourist_nights_annual": int, "population": int, "seasonal_multipliers": dict, "last_updated": str}
