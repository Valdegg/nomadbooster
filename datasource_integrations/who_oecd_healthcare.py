WHO + OECD Healthcare Score Data Integration

Data Sources: 
- WHO "UHC effective coverage" index
- OECD "Doctors per 1,000 inhabitants" statistics
URLs: 
- WHO: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/universal-health-coverage
- OECD: https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm
Access Method: CSV download / REST API
Update Frequency: Static (annual updates)
Data Type: Static city properties

Metric: healthcare_score (int, 0-100 scale, higher = better healthcare)
Description: Composite healthcare score combining WHO's Universal Health Coverage effectiveness 
and OECD's healthcare infrastructure metrics. Weighted combination of coverage quality and 
healthcare resource availability.

Integration Status: âœ… READY - Static metric, reliable official data sources
Implementation: Download WHO UHC CSV + OECD health statistics, merge by country,
calculate composite score, map to cities, and output structured JSON.

Output: ../data/sources/who_oecd_healthcare.json
Schema: {"city": str, "country": str, "healthcare_score": int, "uhc_coverage": float, "doctors_per_1k": float, "last_updated": str}
