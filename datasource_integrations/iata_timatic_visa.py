IATA Timatic Visa Requirements Data Integration

Data Source: IATA Timatic visa requirement database
URL: https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm
Access Method: Playwright automated form submission
Update Frequency: Static-ish (visa policies change infrequently)
Data Type: Static city properties

Metric: visa_free_days (int, 0-365 days)
Description: Number of days citizens of different passport countries can stay visa-free 
in each destination country. Critical for long-stay digital nomads planning 3+ month stays.

Integration Status: âœ… READY - Static-ish metric, Playwright automation needed
Implementation: Use Playwright to automate Timatic widget forms, submit passport country + 
destination country combinations, extract visa-free stay duration, map to cities.

Note: This requires automating the IATA Timatic widget since there's no direct API.
Alternative sources: embassy websites, visa databases, but Timatic is most authoritative.

Output: ../data/sources/iata_timatic_visa.json
Schema: {"city": str, "country": str, "passport_country": str, "visa_free_days": int, "visa_type": str, "last_updated": str}
