Songkick + Bandsintown Events Score Data Integration

Data Sources:
- Songkick Events API (concerts, festivals, live music)
- Bandsintown Events API (music events, artist tours)
URLs:
- Songkick: https://www.songkick.com/developer
- Bandsintown: https://www.bandsintown.com/api/overview
Access Method: JSON APIs with event filtering
Update Frequency: Dynamic (events change constantly)
Data Type: Subjective city properties

Metrics: events_score (int, 0-100), cultural_alignment (list of event types)
Description: Cultural scene quality score based on event density and user genre preferences.
Aggregates event counts by genre, calculates relevance scores, normalizes to 0-100 scale.
Critical for cultural fit matching and subjective city recommendations.

Integration Status: ◻️ Aggregate counts → 0-100 scoring algorithm needed
Implementation: 
1. Fetch events from Songkick + Bandsintown APIs for each city
2. Filter events by user's preferred genres/event types
3. Calculate event density scores (events per capita, venue diversity)
4. Weight by event quality (venue size, artist popularity)
5. Normalize to 0-100 scale for events_score
6. Extract genre tags for cultural_alignment

Scoring Algorithm:
- Event density: Number of events per month per 100k population
- Genre diversity: Variety of music/cultural genres represented
- Venue quality: Mix of small venues, major venues, festivals
- Artist quality: Popularity metrics, international vs local acts
- Seasonal adjustment: Account for seasonal event variations
