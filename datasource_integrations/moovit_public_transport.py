Moovit Public Transit Index Data Integration

Data Source: Moovit Public Transit Index
URL: https://moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index-countries
Access Method: CSV download from Moovit reports
Update Frequency: Static (annual updates)
Data Type: Static city properties

Metric: public_transport_score (int, 0-100 scale, higher = better)
Description: Public transport quality score based on Moovit's comprehensive transit index.
Includes factors like coverage, frequency, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
Normalized to 0-100 scale where 100 = excellent public transport.

Integration Status: âœ… READY - Static metric, reliable transit data
Implementation: Download Moovit Public Transit Index CSV, extract city scores,
normalize to 0-100 scale, validate against local transport databases, and output structured JSON.

Moovit Metrics Include:
- Service coverage and network density
- Frequency and reliability of services  
- Accessibility features
- User satisfaction and wait times
- Integration between transport modes

Output: ../data/sources/moovit_public_transport.json
Schema: {"city": str, "country": str, "public_transport_score": int, "moovit_index": float, "coverage_score": float, "frequency_score": float, "accessibility_score": float, "last_updated": str}
