Wikipedia Architectural Style Data Integration

Data Source: Wikipedia City Pages (Architecture/History sections)
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/[City_Name]
Access Method: Wikipedia API text parsing + LLM analysis
Update Frequency: Static (architectural styles don't change frequently)
Data Type: Static city properties (subjective interpretation)

Metric: architectural_style (enum: baroque, gothic, modern, art_deco, brutalist, etc.)
Description: Dominant architectural style characterizing the city's built environment.
Extracted from Wikipedia descriptions using LLM analysis of architectural mentions,
historical context, and urban development patterns.

Integration Status: ❌ → Needs LLM tagging for style classification
Implementation: 
1. Fetch Wikipedia page content via Wikipedia API
2. Extract architecture/history/urban planning sections
3. Use LLM (Claude/GPT) to identify dominant architectural styles
4. Classify into standardized architectural style categories
5. Weight by prevalence mentions and historical significance

Architectural Style Categories:
- Classical: neoclassical, renaissance, baroque, georgian
- Medieval: gothic, romanesque, byzantine
- Modern: modernist, bauhaus, international_style, contemporary
- Eclectic: art_nouveau, art_deco, victorian, beaux_arts
- Vernacular: traditional, local_style, folk_architecture
- Brutalist: concrete, brutalist, socialist_realist
- Mixed: diverse, eclectic_mix (for cities with no dominant style)

LLM Prompt Strategy:
- Extract architectural mentions from text
- Weight by frequency and prominence in descriptions
- Consider historical development periods
- Account for urban renewal vs historic preservation
- Output dominant style + confidence score

Output: ../data/sources/wikipedia_architectural_style.json
Schema: {"city": str, "country": str, "architectural_style": str, "style_confidence": float, "secondary_styles": list, "architectural_periods": dict, "notable_buildings": list, "last_updated": str}
